# Specification Quality Checklist: Refactor Date APIs and Add Default Config

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) *Note: Mentions Java-specific class names but these are the subject of the feature.*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders *Note: Feature is technical/internal; stakeholders are developers.*
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic *Note: Updated wording to be generic where possible.*
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- The feature is technical refactoring; some technology-specific references are unavoidable.
- The spec is ready for planning.
