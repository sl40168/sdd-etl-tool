## Bug Fix Log

| Date | Bug ID | Description | Affected Component | Root Cause | Fix | Impact Analysis |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|------------|-----|-----------------|
| 2026-01-11 | BF-001 | DolphinDBLoader.loadData() incorrectly grouped data by dataType before insertion, violating specification that requires processing each record individually | DolphinDBLoader.java | Misunderstood specification requirement; used batch grouping instead of per-record processing | Removed groupByDataType() method and loadGroupToTable() method; changed loadData() to loop through each record and call loadSingleRecordToTable() | Data now loads in correct sorted order; ensures per-record processing as required by spec |
| 2026-01-11 | BF-002 | TargetDataModel.getOrderedFieldNames() appended unordered fields (without @ColumnOrder) to end of ordered list, violating requirement that ALL fields MUST have order indicator | TargetDataModel.java | Incorrect assumption that fields without annotations should be included | Removed unorderedFields list; only return fields with @ColumnOrder annotations; ignore fields without annotations | Ensures only properly annotated fields are processed; prevents inclusion of fields missing order indicators |
